## 1. [The discovery of an infrared bipolar outflow](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...540A..95)
-->
<!--
On the basis of GLIMPSE data we discovered a proto-stellar system driving a bipolar outﬂow. The bipolar outﬂow closely resembles the shape of an hourglass in the infrared. The total luminosity 5507 Lsun, derived from IRAS fluxes, indicates the ongoing formation of a massive star in this region. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the driving source is fitted with an online SED fitting tool, which results in a spectral index of about 1.2. This, along with the presence of a bipolar outﬂow, suggests the detection of a Class I protostar. The driving source indicates prominent infrared excesses in color-color diagrams based on archived 2 MASS and GLIMPSE data, which is in line with an early evolutionary stage of the system.

My previous research is in early high-mass star formation including Giant Molecular Cloud,
Infrared Dust Bubble, Hyper-Compact H II Region, Infrared Dark Cloud, Large Scale Survey,
Fragmentation and Deuteration in High-mass Star Formation. With my collaborators, so far
we have published eleven refereed papers, submitted two manuscripts, and been awarded many
observational times on different projects and telescopes.


## 1. Giant Molecular Clouds

There are relatively few H<sub>2</sub>CO mappings of large-area giant molecular cloud (GMCs). H<sub>2</sub>CO
absorption lines are good tracers for low-temperature molecular clouds towards star formation
regions. The aim of the study was to identify H<sub>2</sub>CO distributions in ambient molecular clouds.
We reported simultaneous 6-cm H<sub>2</sub>CO absorption lines and H110α radio recombination line
observations and several large-area mappings at 4.8 GHz on GMCs W49, W3, DR21/W75, and
NGC2024/NGC2023. (Zhang et al., 2012)

## 2. Hyper-Compact HII Regions

The formation of hypercompact (HC) H II regions is an important stage in massive star for-
mation. Spectral line and continuum observations can explore its dynamic conditions. We
presented high angular resolution observations carried out with the SMA and VLA toward the
HC H II region G35.58-0.03. With the 1.3 mm SMA and 1.3 cm VLA, we detected a total of
about 25 transitions of 8 different species and their isotopologues (CO, CH<sub>3</sub>CN, S<sub>2</sub>O , CH<sub>3</sub>CCH,
OCS, CS, H30α H38β, and NH<sub>3</sub>). (Zhang et al., 2014)

## 3. Infrared Dust Bubbles

OB type stars have strong ionizing radiation, and drive energetic winds. The ultraviolet (UV)
radiation from ionizing stars may heat dust and ionize gas to sweep up an expanding bubble
shell. This shell may be the result of feedback leading to a new generation of stars in bubbles.
We studied the formation and fragmentation of bubbles S51, N68, N131 with multi-wavelength
dust and gas observations. Particularly, we propose a scenario in which the bubble N131 forms
from the disruption of a gas filament by strong stellar winds, and fragments under self-gravity.

## 4. Infrared Dark Cloud

Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are ubiquitous in the Milky Way, yet they play a crucial role
in breeding newly-formed stars. With the aim of further understanding the dynamics, chem-
istry, and evolution of IRDCs, we performed new observations with the IRAM 30 m and 
CSO10.4 m telescopes, with tracers HCO<sup>+</sup>, HCN, N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup> , C<sup>18</sup>O, DCO<sup>+</sup>, SiO, and DCN toward
six IRDCs G031.97+00.07, G033.69-00.01, G034.43+00.24, G035.39-00.33, G038.95-00.47, and
G053.11+00.05. We observed many blueshifted and redshifted profiles, respectively, with HCO<sup>+</sup>
and C<sup>18</sup>O toward the same core. This case can be well explained by model “envelope expansion
with core collapse (EECC)”. (Xu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016b)

## 5. Large Scale Survey

TOP-SCOPE are joint survey programs targeting at Planck Cold Clumps. TOP, standing
for “TRAO Observations of Planck cold clumps”, aims at an unbiased CO survey of 2000
Planck Galactic Cold Clumps with the TRAO 14-m telesope. SCOPE, standing for “SCUBA-
2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution”, is a legacy survey using SCUBA-2
onboard of the JCMT at East Asia Observatory to survey 1000 Planck galactic cold clumps at
850 μm. I am leading a subproject to study the gas and dust of 64 Planck Cold Cores in the
Second Quadrant of the Milky Way.

## 6. Fragmentation and triggered star formation

Context. Fragmentation and feedback are two important processes during the early phases of star formation.

Aims. Massive clumps tend to fragment into clusters of cores and condensations, some of which form high-mass stars. In this work,
we study the structure of massive clumps at different scales, analyze the fragmentation process, and investigate the possibility that
star formation is triggered by nearby H II regions.

Methods. We present a high angular resolution study of a sample of massive proto-cluster clumps G18.17, G18.21, G23.97N, G23.98,
G23.44, G23.97S, G25.38, and G25.71. Combining infrared data at 4.5, 8.0, 24, and 70 μm, we use few-arcsecond resolution radio-
and millimeter interferometric data taken at 1.3 cm, 3.5 mm, 1.3 mm, and 870 μm to study their fragmentation and evolution. Our
sample is unique in the sense that all the clumps have neighboring H II regions. Taking advantage of that, we test triggered star
formation using a novel method where we study the alignment of the centres of mass traced by dust emission at multiple scales.

Results. The eight massive clumps, identified based on single dish observations, have masses ranging from 228 to 2279 M  within an
effective radius of R eff ∼ 0.5 pc. We detect compact structures towards six out of the eight clumps. The brightest compact structures
within infrared bright clumps are typically associated with embedded compact radio continuum sources. The smaller scale structures
of R eff ∼ 0.02 pc observed within each clump are mostly gravitationally bound and massive enough to form at least a B3-B0 type star.
Many condensations have masses larger than 8 Msun  at small scale of R eff ∼ 0.02 pc. We find that the two lowest mass and lowest surface
density infrared quiet clumps with < 300 M  do not host any compact sources, calling into question their ability to form high-mass
stars. Although the clumps are mostly infrared quiet, the dynamical movements are active at clump scale (∼ 1 pc).

Conclusions. We studied the spatial distribution of the gas conditions detected at different scales. For some sources we find hints
of external triggering, whereas for others we find no significant pattern that indicates triggering is dynamically unimportant. This
probably indicates that the different clumps go through different evolutionary paths. In this respect, studies with larger samples are
highly desired.

## 7. Gas dynamics and NH<sub>2</sub>D chemistry in high-mass pre/protocluster clumps

Context. The initial stage of star formation is very difficult to study due to its high density (n H 2 > 10^6 cm^−3 ) and low temperature
(T dust < 18 K), which lead to many molecules depleted from the gas phase by freezing out onto dust grains. However, the deuterium
species like the 1 11 -1 01 lines of o-NH<sub>2</sub>D at 85.926 GHz could survive in the extreme condition.

Aims. Deuterated specie NH<sub>2</sub>D as a tracer was observed to probe the initial conditions of high-mass star formation, and high spatial
resolution observations of NH<sub>3</sub> (1, 1) and (2, 2) are used to investigate the temperature and dynamics of the dense and cold objects.

Methods. We present NH<sub>2</sub>D, NH<sub>3</sub> (1, 1) and (2, 2) observations using PdBI and VLA, respectively, towards eight massive precluster
clumps (G18.17, G18.21, G23.97N, G23.98, G23.44, G23.97S, G25.38, and G25.71). We use 3D Gaussclumps to extract NH<sub>2</sub>D
cores and provide a statistical view of their deuterium chemistry.

Results. We find that the NH<sub>2</sub>D cores are gravitationally bound, and can potentially form intermediate- or high-mass stars in future.
The NH<sub>2</sub>D emission is not associated with either a dust continuum or NH<sub>3</sub> peak position or infrared source, but just surrounding the
central continuum cores, suggesting that the NH<sub>2</sub>D has been destroyed by the central young stellar object (YSO) due to its heating.
The NH<sub>2</sub>D cores are likely prestellar or starless cores. We detect extremely high deuterium fractionation of 0.03 6 D frac 6 1.41 with
a median value of 0.45 ± 0.01. We find that the correlation between D frac and T kin is a positive-correlation from 13 to 16.5 K, but
anti-correlation from 16.5 to 22 K. The most suitable condition for NH<sub>2</sub>D to take place reaction may be at the temperature of around
16.5 K. The detected NH<sub>2</sub>D lines are very narrow with a median value of around 0.94 ± 0.09 km/s, which is regulated by turbulent
broadening. Using NH<sub>3</sub> (1, 1) as a dynamical tracer, we find very complicated dynamical movement towards all the eight clumps, as
can be explained by processes such as outflow, rotation, convergent flow, collision, and large velocity gradient.

Conclusions. The sample generally exhibit clear signatures of Keplerian disk, suggesting that the accretion rate could be increasing
gradually from prestellar core to evolved source stages.
