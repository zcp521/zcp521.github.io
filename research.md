## 1. [The discovery of an infrared bipolar outflow](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...540A..95)
-->
<!--
On the basis of GLIMPSE data we discovered a proto-stellar system driving a bipolar outﬂow. The bipolar outﬂow closely resembles the shape of an hourglass in the infrared. The total luminosity 5507 Lsun, derived from IRAS fluxes, indicates the ongoing formation of a massive star in this region. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the driving source is fitted with an online SED fitting tool, which results in a spectral index of about 1.2. This, along with the presence of a bipolar outﬂow, suggests the detection of a Class I protostar. The driving source indicates prominent infrared excesses in color-color diagrams based on archived 2 MASS and GLIMPSE data, which is in line with an early evolutionary stage of the system.

My previous research is in early high-mass star formation including Giant Molecular Cloud,
Infrared Dust Bubble, Hyper-Compact H II Region, Infrared Dark Cloud, Large Scale Survey,
Fragmentation and Deuteration in High-mass Star Formation. With my collaborators, so far
we have published eleven refereed papers, submitted two manuscripts, and been awarded many
observational times on different projects and telescopes.


## 1. Giant Molecular Clouds

There are relatively few H 2 CO mappings of large-area giant molecular cloud (GMCs). H2CO
absorption lines are good tracers for low-temperature molecular clouds towards star formation
regions. The aim of the study was to identify H2CO distributions in ambient molecular clouds.
We reported simultaneous 6-cm H 2 CO absorption lines and H110α radio recombination line
observations and several large-area mappings at 4.8 GHz on GMCs W49, W3, DR21/W75, and
NGC2024/NGC2023. (Zhang et al., 2012)


## 2. Hyper-Compact HII Regions


The formation of hypercompact (HC) H II regions is an important stage in massive star for-
mation. Spectral line and continuum observations can explore its dynamic conditions. We
presented high angular resolution observations carried out with the SMA and VLA toward the
HC H II region G35.58-0.03. With the 1.3 mm SMA and 1.3 cm VLA, we detected a total of
about 25 transitions of 8 different species and their isotopologues (CO, CH3CN, SO2 , CH3CCH,
OCS, CS, H30α H38β, and NH3 ). (Zhang et al., 2014)


## 3. Infrared Dust Bubbles


OB type stars have strong ionizing radiation, and drive energetic winds. The ultraviolet (UV)
radiation from ionizing stars may heat dust and ionize gas to sweep up an expanding bubble
shell. This shell may be the result of feedback leading to a new generation of stars in bubbles.
We studied the formation and fragmentation of bubbles S51, N68, N131 with multi-wavelength
dust and gas observations. Particularly, we propose a scenario in which the bubble N131 forms
from the disruption of a gas filament by strong stellar winds, and fragments under self-gravity.
(Zhang & Wang, 2012, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016a)


## 4. Infrared Dark Cloud


Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are ubiquitous in the Milky Way, yet they play a crucial role
in breeding newly-formed stars. With the aim of further understanding the dynamics, chem-
istry, and evolution of IRDCs, we performed new observations with the IRAM 30 m and 
CSO10.4 m telescopes, with tracers HCO+ , HCN, N2H+ , C18O, DCO+ , SiO, and DCN toward
six IRDCs G031.97+00.07, G033.69-00.01, G034.43+00.24, G035.39-00.33, G038.95-00.47, and
G053.11+00.05. We observed many blueshifted and redshifted profiles, respectively, with HCO +
and C18O toward the same core. This case can be well explained by model “envelope expansion
with core collapse (EECC)”. (Xu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016b)


# 5. Large Scale Survey


TOP-SCOPE are joint survey programs targeting at Planck Cold Clumps. TOP, standing
for “TRAO Observations of Planck cold clumps”, aims at an unbiased CO survey of 2000
Planck Galactic Cold Clumps with the TRAO 14-m telesope. SCOPE, standing for “SCUBA-
2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution”, is a legacy survey using SCUBA-2
onboard of the JCMT at East Asia Observatory to survey 1000 Planck galactic cold clumps at
850 μm. I am leading a subproject to study the gas and dust of 64 Planck Cold Cores in the
Second Quadrant of the Milky Way.


## 6. Fragmentation, Deuteration, and Evolution


The fragmentation at the earliest phases is an important process of massive star formation.
Investigations of starless cores and prestellar cores are crucial for understanding the origin of
the stellar initial mass function. However, few high-angular resolution observations toward the
earliest high-mass clumps have been done so far. Eight massive precluster clumps (G18.17,
G18.21, G23.97N, G23.98, G23.44, G23.97S, G25.38, G25.71) were selected from the SCUBA
Massive Pre/Protocluster core Survey at 850 and 450 μm. VLA at 1.3 cm, PdBI at 3.5 & 1.3
mm, APEX at 870 μm observations were followed up, and archival infrared data at 4.5, 8.0, 24,
and 70 μm are combined to study the fragmentation and evolution of these eight clumps. The
spectral data including NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2) lines NH2D, C18O (2-1), H 13 CN, HC15N, and SO
line data will be used to study the dynamics, stability, and chemistry of these samples. Finally,
we want to further unveil the initial conditions of high-mass star formation.
