## 4. [High-mass starless clumps in the inner Galactic Plane]({{ site.baseurl }}/hmscs.html)

From 10861 ATLASGAL clump, we identified 463 high-mass starless clump 
(HMSC) candidates with −60 < l < 60 degree and −1 < b < 1 degree. 
All of these sources have been queried in SIMBAD to make sure they 
are not associated with any known star-forming indicator. Young 
stellar objects were identified from the GLIMPSE catalog using 
color-based criteria and the associated clumps were excluded. We 
also make sure that the HMSC candidates have neither point sources 
at 24 and 70 µm nor strong extended emission at 24 µm. Most of the 
identified HMSCs are infrared dark and some are even dark at 70 µm. 
Their distribution shows crowding in Galactic spiral arms and toward 
the Galactic center and some well known star-forming complexes, 
and some HMSCs are associated with large-scale filaments. Some 
basic parameters were attained from column density and dust 
temperature maps which were constructed via fitting far-infrared 
and submillimeter continuum data to modified blackbodies. The 
HMSC candidates have sizes, masses, and densities similar to 
clumps associated with Class II methanol masers and H ii regions, 
suggesting that these starless clumps will evolve into star-forming 
clumps. More than 90% of the HMSC candidates have densities above some 
proposed thresholds for forming high-mass stars. The HMSC candidates 
have dust temperatures and luminosity-to-mass ratios significantly 
lower than star-forming sources, suggesting they are genuinely at 
very early stages of high-mass star formation. Seventeen 
sources with equivalent radii < 0.15 pc and \(Σ > 0.08 g cm^2\) 
could be possible high-mass starless cores. Further investigations 
toward these HMSCs would undoubtedly shed light on comprehensively 
understanding the birth of high-mass stars.

## 3. [Dense gas in molecular cores associated with *Planck* Galactic cold clumps](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...820...37Y)

We have carried out the first survey of dense gas toward Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs). Observations in the J = 1–0 transitions of HCO+ and HCN toward 621 molecular cores associated with PGCCs were performed using the Purple Mountain Observatory’s 13.7 m telescope. Among them, 250 sources were detected, including 230 cores detected in HCO+ and 158 in HCN. Spectra of the J = 1–0 transitions from 12CO, 13CO, and C18O at the centers of the 250 cores were extracted from previous mapping observations to construct a multi-line data set. The significantly low detection rate of asymmetric double-peaked profiles, together with the good consistency among central velocities of CO, HCO + , and HCN spectra, suggests that the CO-selected Planck cores are more quiescent than classical star-forming regions. The small difference between line widths of C18O and HCN indicates that the inner regions of CO-selected Planck cores are no more turbulent than the exterior. The velocity-integrated intensities and abundances of HCO+ are positively correlated with those of HCN, suggesting that these two species are well coupled and chemically connected. The detected abundances of both HCO+ and HCN are significantly lower than values in other low- to high-mass star-forming regions. The low abundances may be due to beam dilution. On the basis of an inspection of the parameters given in the PGCC catalog, we suggest that there may be about 1000 PGCC objects that have a sufficient reservoir of dense gas to form stars.

## 2. [Expanding shell and star formation in the infrared dust bubble N6](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...797...40Y)

We have carried out a multiwavelength study of the infrared dust bubble N6 to extensively investigate the molecular environs and star-forming activities therein. Mapping observations in 12CO J = 1–0 and 13CO J = 1–0 performed with the Purple Mountain Observatory 13.7 m telescope have revealed four velocity components. Comparison between distributions of each component and the infrared emission suggests that three components are correlated with N6. There are 10 molecular clumps detected. Among them, five have reliable detections in both 12 CO and 13CO and have similar LTE and non-LTE masses ranging from 200 to higher than 5000 Msun. With larger gas masses than virial masses, these five clumps are gravitationally unstable and have the potential to collapse to form new stars. The other five clumps are only reliably detected in 12 CO and have relatively small masses. Five clumps are located on the border of the ring structure, and four of them are elongated along the shell. This is well in agreement with the collect-and-collapse scenario. The detected velocity gradient reveals that the ring structure is still under expansion owing to stellar winds from the exciting star(s). Furthermore, 99 young stellar objects (YSOs) have been identified based on their infrared colors. A group of YSOs reside inside the ring, indicating active star formation in N6. Although no confirmative features of triggered star formation are detected, the bubble and the enclosed H ii region have profoundly reconstructed the natal cloud and altered the dynamics therein.

## 1. [The discovery of an infrared bipolar outflow](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...540A..95)

On the basis of GLIMPSE data we discovered a proto-stellar system driving a bipolar outﬂow. The bipolar outﬂow closely resembles the shape of an hourglass in the infrared. The total luminosity 5507 Lsun, derived from IRAS fluxes, indicates the ongoing formation of a massive star in this region. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the driving source is fitted with an online SED fitting tool, which results in a spectral index of about 1.2. This, along with the presence of a bipolar outﬂow, suggests the detection of a Class I protostar. The driving source indicates prominent infrared excesses in color-color diagrams based on archived 2 MASS and GLIMPSE data, which is in line with an early evolutionary stage of the system.
