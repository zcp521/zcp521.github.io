# Project Introduction

From 10861 ATLASGAL clump, we identified 463 high-mass starless clump 
(HMSC) candidates with −60 < l < 60 degree and −1 < b < 1 degree. 
All of these sources have been queried in SIMBAD to make sure they 
are not associated with any known star-forming indicator. Young 
stellar objects were identified from the GLIMPSE catalog using 
color-based criteria and the associated clumps were excluded. We 
also make sure that the HMSC candidates have neither point sources 
at 24 and 70 µm nor strong extended emission at 24 µm. Most of the 
identified HMSCs are infrared dark and some are even dark at 70 µm. 
Their distribution shows crowding in Galactic spiral arms and toward 
the Galactic center and some well known star-forming complexes, 
and some HMSCs are associated with large-scale filaments. Some 
basic parameters were attained from column density and dust 
temperature maps which were constructed via fitting far-infrared 
and submillimeter continuum data to modified blackbodies. The 
HMSC candidates have sizes, masses, and densities similar to 
clumps associated with Class II methanol masers and H ii regions, 
suggesting that these starless clumps will evolve into star-forming 
clumps. More than 90% of the HMSC candidates have densities above some 
proposed thresholds for forming high-mass stars. The HMSC candidates 
have dust temperatures and luminosity-to-mass ratios significantly 
lower than star-forming sources, suggesting they are genuinely at 
very early stages of high-mass star formation. Twenty sources with equivalent radii < 0.15 pc and mass surface densities > 0.08 g cm^2\ 
could be possible high-mass starless cores. Further investigations 
toward these HMSCs would undoubtedly shed light on comprehensively 
understanding the birth of high-mass stars.
