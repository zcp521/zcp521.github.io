# Project Introduction

From 10861 ATLASGAL clump, we identified 463 high-mass starless clump 
(HMSC) candidates with −60 < l < 60 degree and −1 < b < 1 degree. 
All of these sources have been queried in SIMBAD to make sure they 
are not associated with any known star-forming indicator. Young 
stellar objects were identified from the GLIMPSE catalog using 
color-based criteria and the associated clumps were excluded. We 
also make sure that the HMSC candidates have neither point sources 
at 24 and 70 µm nor strong extended emission at 24 µm. Most of the 
identified HMSCs are infrared dark and some are even dark at 70 µm. 
Their distribution shows crowding in Galactic spiral arms and toward 
the Galactic center and some well known star-forming complexes, 
and some HMSCs are associated with large-scale filaments. Some 
basic parameters were attained from column density and dust 
temperature maps which were constructed via fitting far-infrared 
and submillimeter continuum data to modified blackbodies. The 
HMSC candidates have sizes, masses, and densities similar to 
clumps associated with Class II methanol masers and H ii regions, 
suggesting that these starless clumps will evolve into star-forming 
clumps. More than 90% of the HMSC candidates have densities above some 
proposed thresholds for forming high-mass stars. The HMSC candidates 
have dust temperatures and luminosity-to-mass ratios significantly 
lower than star-forming sources, suggesting they are genuinely at 
very early stages of high-mass star formation. Twenty sources with equivalent radii < 0.15 pc and mass surface densities > 0.08 g cm^2\ 
could be possible high-mass starless cores. Further investigations 
toward these HMSCs would undoubtedly shed light on comprehensively 
understanding the birth of high-mass stars.

# Main results

1. From more than 10000 dense sources detected in the 
ATLASGAL survey, a sample of 463 high-mass starless clump (HMSC) candidates
were identified based on *Spitzer*/GLIMPSE, *Spitzer*/MIPSGAL, 
*Herschel*/Hi-GAL and *APEX*/ATLASGAL survey data.
These clumps are not associated with any known star-forming indicators, the HMSC
candidates represents a highly reliable catalog of 
starless objects.

2. Distances for all the 463 HMSC candidates were determined based on their systemic 
velocities. Their distribution in
Galactic longitude is similar to that observed in the whole sample of ATLASGAL 
clumps, showing overdensities toward the Galactic center and several well
known star-forming regions. While plotted on the face-on Milky Way, the majority 
of the sources are located in spiral arms in the inner Galaxy, with
Galactocentric distances less than 8.34 kpc.

3. Some basic parameters were derived via fitting data at wavelengths from
160 to 870 µm to modified blackbodies. These HMSC candidates
have a median beam-averaged H2 column density 
of 4.4E22 cm2, a median 
mass of 1019 Msun, a median luminosity of 1329 Lsun, and a median luminosity-to-mass
ratio of 1.6 Lsun/Msun.

4. More than 700 clumps associated with 6.7 GHz methanol masers and more than 400 clumps
associated with HII regions were scrutinised using the same analysis techniques to enable us to carry out comparative diagnosis with the newly identified starless clumps. These comparison samples have median size, mass and density similar to those of high-mass star-forming clumps.
The HMSC candidates may be common entities but they are at an earlier evolutionary stage.

5. All of the HMSC candidates except one fulfill the
star-formation threshold proposed in Lada et al. (2010) 
and Heiderman et al. (2010). In the mass-radius diagram, 
more than 80% (378/463) starless clumps are
above the relationship for high-mass star formation 
proposed by Kauffmann & Pillai (2010),
About 97% HMSC candidates have mass surface densities
above threshold defined in Urquhart et al. (2014),
suggesting most of them have potential to form high-mass stars.

6. Our HMSC candidates have median and mean dust temperatures of
16.17 and 16.21 K, significantly colder than star-forming clumps and 
consistent with other samples of starless clumps reported in the literature.
The median luminosity-to-mass ratio of the HMSC candidates is as low as
1.6 Lsun/Msun. Further analysis shows that 
these HMSCs are externally heated, suggesting that 
these objects truly represent a very early phase of high-mass star formation.

7. Compared to the BGPS starless clumps in Svobada et al. (2016), 
our HMSC candidates have larger masses and higher densities, which is 
mainly due to the inclusion of -10<l<10 degree region, the higher spatial resolution
of ATLASGAL observations, and the different source extraction method.

8. There are 20 HMSC candidates having equivalent radii smaller than 
0.15 pc. With small sizes,large masses, and high densities, 
they may represent a small sample of high-mass starless cores.
